## Welcome to Database Learning

### Introduction
1. What is SQL?
   
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to query, insert, update, and delete data stored in a database.
2. Installing SQL Server on Windows
3. Installing SQL Server on Mac (via Docker or remote access)

#### Difference Between DBMS and RDBMS
Although both DBMS and RDBMS are used to store information in a physical database, there are significant differences between them. Below is a comparison of the main differences:
| No. | DBMS                                                                     | RDBMS                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | DBMS applications store data as files.                                   | RDBMS applications store data in a tabular form.                                                                   |
| 2   | Data is generally stored in hierarchical or navigational form.           | Data is stored in tables with identifiers called primary keys.                                                     |
| 3   | Normalization is not present in DBMS.                                    | Normalization is present in RDBMS.                                                                                 |
| 4   | DBMS does not apply any security regarding data manipulation.            | RDBMS defines integrity constraints to ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability). |
| 5   | DBMS uses a file system, so there is no relationship between tables.     | RDBMS stores data in tables with relationships between them.                                                       |
| 6   | DBMS provides uniform methods to access data.                            | RDBMS supports a tabular structure and relationships for accessing stored information.                             |
| 7   | DBMS does not support distributed databases.                             | RDBMS supports distributed databases.                                                                              |
| 8   | DBMS is suited for small organizations with single users and small data. | RDBMS is designed to handle large data and support multiple users.                                                 |
| 9   | Examples: File systems, XML, etc.                                        | Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.                                                              |

### Database Languages
A database system provides various languages for defining, manipulating, and controlling data. These include the 
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**,
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**,
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**, and
- **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**.

In practice, these languages are not separate but form parts of a single database language, such as **SQL**.

#### Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL is used to specify the database schema. It is used for creating and altering database structures such as tables, schemas, indexes, and constraints. The following operations are part of DDL:
| **Operation** | **Description**                                                       | **Example**                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| CREATE        | To create a database instance or objects like tables, schemas, etc.   | `CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(100));`  |
| ALTER         | To alter the structure of the database or database objects.           | `ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN Age INT;`            |
| DROP          | To drop database instances or objects (e.g., tables, schemas).        | `DROP TABLE Employees;`                                |
| TRUNCATE      | To delete all records from a table without removing the table itself. | `TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;`                            |
| RENAME        | To rename a database object (e.g., a table, column, etc.).            | `RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;`                     |
| COMMENT       | To add comments to database objects (e.g., tables, columns).          | `COMMENT ON COLUMN Employees.Name IS 'Employee Name';` |

Since these commands define or update the schema, they are categorized as part of **Data Definition Language**.

#### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML is used for accessing and manipulating data stored in a database. The following operations are part of DML:
| Command    | Description                              | Example                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SELECT** | To read records from one or more tables. | `SELECT * FROM Employees;`                                   |
| **INSERT** | To insert records into tables.           | `INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Age) VALUES ('John Doe', 30);` |
| **UPDATE** | To update existing data in a table.      | `UPDATE Employees SET Age = 31 WHERE Name = 'John Doe';`     |
| **DELETE** | To delete records from a table.          | `DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'John Doe';`             |

#### Data Control Language (DCL)
DCL is used for granting and revoking access to the database. The main DCL operations are:
| Command    | Description                              | Example                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **GRANT**  | To give access privileges to a user.     | `GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO user_name;`    |
| **REVOKE** | To remove access privileges from a user. | `REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM user_name;` |

Although DDL, DML, and DCL are often considered separate languages, they are actually components of a single database language like SQL.

#### Transaction Control Language (TCL)
TCL commands manage changes to the database that are made using DML. These changes can either be committed (saved) or rolled back (undone) using TCL commands:
| Command      | Description                                                         | Example     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **COMMIT**   | To save all changes made by DML commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  | `COMMIT;`   |
| **ROLLBACK** | To undo changes made by DML commands and revert the database state. | `ROLLBACK;` |

#### Keys in Relational Databases
Keys are essential in relational databases for identifying unique rows and establishing relationships between tables. Here's a breakdown of the different types of keys in a relational database:

##### Primary Key
A **Primary Key** is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot have `NULL` values.

`Example`
| Roll | Name  | Age |
| ---- | ----- | --- |
| 101  | Steve | 23  |
| 102  | John  | 24  |
Here, `Roll` is the primary key because each roll number is unique.

> Note: Attributes like `Name` or `Age` cannot be primary keys, as they may not be unique.

##### Super Key
A **Super Key** is a set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a row in a table. Super keys can contain additional attributes beyond what is necessary for unique identification.

`Example`
| Emp_SSN | Emp_Number | Emp_Name |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 258963  | 256        | Steve    |
| 258741  | 254        | Robert   |

**Super Keys:**
- {Emp_SSN}
- {Emp_Number}
- {Emp_SSN, Emp_Number}
- {Emp_SSN, Emp_Name}
- {Emp_SSN, Emp_Number, Emp_Name}
- {Emp_Number, Emp_Name}

##### Candidate Key
A **Candidate Key** is a minimal super key, meaning it uniquely identifies rows without any redundant attributes. A table can have multiple candidate keys.

`Example`
For the table above, the following are candidate keys:
- {Emp_SSN}
- {Emp_Number}

Other sets, such as {Emp_SSN, Emp_Name}, contain redundant attributes.

##### Primary Key vs Candidate Key
- All candidate keys are super keys, but not all super keys are candidate keys.
- The **Primary Key** is selected from the set of candidate keys. A database designer or administrator typically chooses the primary key.

##### Alternate Key
An **Alternate Key** is any candidate key that is not selected as the primary key. These keys remain as alternative ways to uniquely identify rows.

`Example`
If `{Emp_SSN}` is selected as the primary key, `{Emp_Number}` becomes the alternate key.

##### Composite Key
A **Composite Key** is a key that consists of more than one attribute to uniquely identify a row. Composite keys are typically used when a single attribute is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness.

`Example`
| Cust_Id | Order_Id | Product_Code | Product_Count |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 125     | 625      | 352          | 35            |
| 225     | 552      | 356          | 36            |

**Composite Key:**
- {Cust_Id, Product_Code}

##### Foreign Key
A **Foreign Key** is a column in a table that points to the primary key of another table. It establishes relationships between two tables.

`Example`
| Course_Id | Stu_Id |
| --------- | ------ |
| C01       | 101    |
| C02       | 102    |

In the above example, `Stu_Id` is a foreign key in the **Course_enrollment** table that references the **Student** table.

##### Constraints in Databases
Constraints are rules that limit the types of data that can be inserted, updated, or deleted from a table. They ensure data integrity and consistency.

##### Types of Constraints:
| **Constraint**  | **Description**                                                           | **Example**                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NOT NULL**    | Ensures that a column cannot contain a `NULL` value.                      | `CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT NOT NULL, Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL);`                                 |
| **UNIQUE**      | Ensures that all values in a column are unique.                           | `CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT UNIQUE, Name VARCHAR(100));`                                            |
| **DEFAULT**     | Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.         | `CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'John Doe');`                                |
| **CHECK**       | Ensures that values in a column fall within a specific range.             | `CREATE TABLE Employees (Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18));`                                                   |
| **PRIMARY KEY** | Uniquely identifies each record in a table.                               | `CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100));`                                       |
| **FOREIGN KEY** | Ensures that a value in a column corresponds to a value in another table. | `CREATE TABLE Orders (OrderID INT, EmployeeID INT, FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(ID));` |

`Example of Constraints`
```sql
CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    ROLL_NO INT NOT NULL,
    STU_NAME VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
    STU_AGE INT NOT NULL,
    STU_ADDRESS VARCHAR(235),
    PRIMARY KEY (ROLL_NO)
);
```

#### Mapping Cardinality
Mapping cardinality defines the number of relationships between entities in a relational database.
| **Relationship** | **Description**                                                                                                                               | **Example**                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **One to One**   | An entity in set A can be associated with at most one entity in set B, and vice versa.                                                        | `A person can have one passport, and a passport can belong to one person.`                       |
| **One to Many**  | An entity in set A can be associated with multiple entities in set B, but an entity in set B can only be associated with one entity in set A. | `A department can have multiple employees, but an employee can belong to only one department.`   |
| **Many to One**  | An entity in set A can only be associated with one entity in set B, but an entity in set B can be associated with multiple entities in set A. | `Many employees can belong to one department, but each employee belongs to only one department.` |
| **Many to Many** | An entity in set A can be associated with multiple entities in set B, and vice versa.                                                         | `Students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.`           |

`Example of One to Many`
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(20),
    last_name VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Order (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT,
    order_details VARCHAR(50),
    CONSTRAINT fk_Customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer
);
```

#### Normalization in DBMS
Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. There are several Normal Forms (NF), each with its own set of rules.

#### Types of Normal Forms:
- `1NF (First Normal Form):` Ensures that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
- `2NF (Second Normal Form):` Removes partial dependency on a candidate key.
- `3NF (Third Normal Form):` Eliminates transitive dependency.
- `BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):` A stricter version of 3NF.

Example of First Normal Form (1NF)
If a table contains a column with multiple values (e.g., multiple phone numbers), it violates 1NF. To comply with 1NF, each column should contain only atomic values.

##### Example of Normalization to 1NF
`Before 1NF (Non-compliant)`
| Emp_Id | Emp_Name | Emp_Mobile             |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| 102    | Jon      | 8812121212, 9900012222 |
| 103    | Ron      | 7778881212             |

`Explanation:` The `Emp_Mobile` column contains multiple values for Jon, which violates the rule of 1NF that requires columns to have atomic (single) values.

`After 1NF (Compliant)`
| Emp_Id | Emp_Name | Emp_Mobile |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| 102    | Jon      | 8812121212 |
| 102    | Jon      | 9900012222 |
| 103    | Ron      | 7778881212 |

`Explanation:` The `Emp_Mobile` column now contains only a single mobile number per row, ensuring that each attribute holds atomic values, which complies with **1NF**.
- `Example of Second Normal Form (2NF):` A table is in 2NF if it's in 1NF and if there is no partial dependency (i.e., no non-prime attribute depends on a subset of a candidate key).
- `Example of Third Normal Form (3NF):` A table is in 3NF if it’s in 2NF and there is no transitive dependency, meaning non-prime attributes should not depend on other non-prime attributes.
- `Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):` BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF where, for every functional dependency, the left side must be a super key.

By applying normalization, you can eliminate various types of anomalies (insertion, update, and deletion anomalies) and ensure the database maintains consistency and integrity.
